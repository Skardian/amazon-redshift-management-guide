# Monitoring the Data API<a name="data-api-monitoring"></a>

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of the Data API and your other AWS solutions\. AWS provides the following monitoring tools to watch the Data API, report when something is wrong, and take automatic actions when appropriate: 
+ Amazon EventBridge can be used to automate your AWS services and respond automatically to system events, such as application availability issues or resource changes\. Events from AWS services are delivered to EventBridge in near\-real time\. You can write simple rules to indicate which events are of interest to you and which automated actions to take when an event matches a rule\. For more information, see the [Amazon EventBridge User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/)\. 
+ AWS CloudTrail captures API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your AWS account and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify\. You can identify which users and accounts called AWS, the source IP address from which the calls were made, and when the calls occurred\. To learn more about how Amazon Redshift is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, see [Logging with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/logging-with-cloudtrail.html)\. For more information about CloudTrail, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/)\.
